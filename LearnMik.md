<h1 id="introduction-1">1.0 Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-mik-and-why-should-you-use-it">1.1 What is Mik and why
should you use it</h2>
<p>Mik is a general-purpose programming language that provides low level
features such as <strong>pointers</strong>, <strong>memory
management</strong>, <strong>assembly functions</strong>, etc. while
being <strong>easy</strong> to use, <strong>fast</strong>, and
<strong>readable</strong>. What mik is depends solely on the programmer.
It can be easy like java, and hard like C.</p>
<p><strong>It’s up to You!</strong></p>
<h1 id="get-started-1"><strong>2.0 Get Started</strong></h1>
<p>Now that we covered what mik is and why one may use it, we can
finally start, right? Well… no. Unfortunately not. To run any program we
need a compiler (which is just a program that takes source code and
generates machine code). Therefore we first need:</p>
<h2 id="installation-guide"><strong>2.1 Installation guide</strong></h2>
<p>You have two options to install the Mik compiler (mic):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Via the <a
href="%22https://mikpl.gq/Download.html%22">website</a></li>
<li>Via Github. Which i will cover here</li>
</ol>
<p>First run the following command</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MikOS-ProgrammingLanguage/MicNewDawn.git</code></pre>
<p>Then go into the directory you cloned the repo to and execute the
following command</p>
<pre><code>λ&gt; cd your/path/MicNewDawn
λ&gt; make
λ&gt; export PATH=&quot;your/path/MicNewDawn/:$PATH&quot;
λ&gt; mic -install</code></pre>
<p>The mik compiler as well as the mik package manager should now be
ready to use!</p>
<h2 id="mic-and-mip"><strong>2.2 Mic and Mip</strong></h2>
<h3 id="mic"><strong>Mic</strong></h3>
<p>mic, which is an acronym for Mik compiler, is the tool that compiles
your programs!</p>
<h3 id="mip"><strong>Mip</strong></h3>
<p>mip, which is an acronym for Mik package manager, is a package
manager that lets you: download packages, initialize your project, and
manage your projects!</p>
<h2 id="hello-world"><strong>2.3 Hello World!</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we covered all that boring stuff, let’s start programming.
And what would be a better example than the good old <em>“Hello,
World!”</em></p>
<p>First create a file ending in <em>.mik</em></p>
<p>Then write the following code:</p>
<pre><code>puts(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Simple, right? Yes! Puts is just a function that takes a string as an
argument and prints it to stdio (Your terminal)</p>
